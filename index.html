						<strong>Dear NALU community,</strong> <br /><br />

						This is not an easy
						conversation for us, but we’ve always preached transparency in our
						communication with you and hard times are no exception. We have been struggling
						for a while now and the current global situation has forced us to take a
						decision. <br /><br />

						<strong>NALU came to life 6
						years ago as an ode to the women’s bodies, as a pledge to bring a more
						comfort-oriented approach to the very pieces that are the closest to women’s bodies,
						to challenge the lingerie industry, to challenge mindsets of beauty and to show
						that undergarments don’t have to be all wires and padding. High-quality
						fabrics, simple and functional designs, pieces that allow you to move freely
						and to feel at ease – promises that we’ve kept all these years, while trying to
							innovate and bring more styles.</strong> <br /><br />

						<!--You’ve probably seen
						lately some other independent small businesses and brands across  industries that are about to close their
						doors or to find other ways to continue their mission. Unfortunately, the last
						years of the pandemic have not been easy on us as well. We have been impacted a
						lot by higher cost of operation – due to the worldwide shortage of raw
						materials, rising costs of production and a continuous increase of taxes. <br /><br />-->

						As a very small team, we have poured so much
						into making NALU what it is today and we feel that now it’s the time to take a longer break
						and look for new paths and adventures. <br /><br />

						There is also one thing we have to mention now. For us, the community we built around NALU during
						all these years was the most inspiring, fulfilling and valuable thing we are now grateful for. <br /><br />

						<strong>We promise to keep promoting sustainability and women empowerment, and we encourage
							you to do the same. But for now, this is a goodbye.</strong> <br /><br />

						Thank you for being here! <br />
					</p>
					<p class="text-intro text-right">
						With love & gratitude, <br />
							<strong>NALU Team</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />
